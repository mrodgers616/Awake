    "question": "How Does the Awake Platform Work?",
    "answer": "Awake is empowering everyday investors to be activists. By linking your brokerage account (Robinhood, Fidelity, etc) and supporting campaigns on our platform you can play a role in getting companies to take action. We'll use data we aggregate on the platform as leverage with the companies we target. We can approach companies with proof that their OWNERS want to see the changes we're advocating for."

    "question": "It's Free!",
    "answer": "It costs nothing to use Awake and we will never ask for payment information. You can support this campaign by signing up and creating an account! From there, you can link a brokerage account to signal your support for a campaign. If you want to join our community, check out our Discord server or reach out to us on Twitter."
