    "question": "How Does the ClimateDAO Platform Work?",
    "answer": "ClimateDAO is empowering everyday investors to be activists. Voting on shareholder proposals is a complicated and tedious process. ClimateDAO makes it easy for investors to have their voices heard at the companies they own. Whether you own stock through a brokerage, a pension or a 401k, you should have a say. We act as the missing link between shareholders who care about complex issues and the fund managers voting on their behalf. The data we aggregate will allow fund managers to make more informed decisions based on their investor’s sentiment."

    "question": "What is Shareholder Activism? Where do I fit in?",
    "answer": "Shareholder Activism is a way that shareholders can influence a corporation's behavior by exercising their rights as partial owners. While minority shareholders don't run the day-to-day operations, several ways exist for them to influence a company’s board of directors and executive management actions. These methods can range from dialogue with managers to formal proposals, which are voted on by all shareholders at a company's annual meeting. You can take action with ClimateDAO by linking your brokerage account, signaling support with your own shares, and sourcing opportunities by performing due diligence on active proposals."

    "question": "What’s a Campaign vs a Proposal?",
    "answer": "Proposals are formal shareholder proposals that will pop up a few times a year around a company's annual general meeting. You can vote on proposals if you own shares in the company. A campaign is an informal petition for a company or organization to make some change. These campaigns do not require you to hold shares in the target company, but having shares greatly increases the chance the peition will be successful."
