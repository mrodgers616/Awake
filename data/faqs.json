    "question": "How Does the Awake Platform Work?",
    "answer": "Awake is empowering everyday investors to be activists. By linking your brokerage account (Robinhood, Fidelity, etc) and supporting campaigns on our platform you can play a role in getting companies to take action. We'll use data we aggregate on the platform as leverage with the companies we target. We can approach companies with proof that their OWNERS want to see the changes we're advocating for."

    "question": "What is Shareholder Activism? Where do I fit in?",
    "answer": "Shareholder Activism is a way that shareholders can influence a corporation's behavior by exercising their rights as partial owners. While minority shareholders don't run the day-to-day operations, several ways exist for them to influence a company’s board of directors and executive management actions. These methods can range from dialogue with managers to formal proposals, which are voted on by all shareholders at a company's annual meeting. You can take action with Awake by linking your brokerage account, signaling support with your own shares, and sourcing opportunities by performing due diligence on active proposals."

    "question": "What’s a Campaign vs a Proposal?",
    "answer": "Proposals are shorthand for formal 'shareholder proposals' that are submitted by an owner of the company before the company's annual general meeting. A campaign is an informal petition for a company or organization to make some change. These campaigns do not require you to hold shares in the target company, but having shares greatly increases the chance the peition will be successful. "
