    "question": "How Does the ClimateDAO Platform Work?",
    "answer": "ClimateDAO’s mission is to stop the causes climate change. We do this through a two-fold approach. First, ClimateDAO buys shares of targeted companies to request they make the changes that our community suggests. The shares are purchased with the pooled capital from the token launch and the targeted companies are decided by the token holders. Second by allowing user’s to connect their brokerage account and signal support for a campaign, we can approach the company directly with the sentiment from their shareholders."

    "question": "What is Shareholder Activism? Where do I fit in?",
    "answer": "Shareholder Activism is a way that shareholders can influence a corporation's behavior by exercising their rights as partial owners. While minority shareholders don't run the day-to-day operations, several ways exist for them to influence a company’s board of directors and executive management actions. These methods can range from dialogue with managers to formal proposals, which are voted on by all shareholders at a company's annual meeting. You can take action with ClimateDAO by purchasing our token to build up the treasury, linking a brokerage account to signal support with your own shares, sourcing opportunities by performing due diligence on active proposals, and participating in governance by voting with your tokens."

    "question": "What’s a Campaign vs a Proposal?",
    "answer": "Proposals are the process by which the community decides on new companies to target based on the reasoning and support provided by the proposer. There is a minimum amount of tokens required to submit a proposal but any token holder can vote on active proposals. While a proposal is active, the community will decide through their voting power if we start a campaign. A campaign is the entire process of getting a company to decarbonize from the proposal passing to tangible change."
